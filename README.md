# angular2-jwt

**angular2-jwt** is a helper library for working with [JWTs](http://jwt.io/introduction) in your Angular 2 applications.

For examples on integrating **angular2-jwt** with Webpack and SystemJS, see [auth0-angular2](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular2).

## Key Features

* Send a JWT on a per-request basis using the **explicit `AuthHttp`** class
* **Decode a JWT** from your Angular 2 app
* Check the **expiration date** of the JWT
* Call **Token Refresh** function if the JWT has expired
* Conditionally allow **route navigation** based on JWT status

## Installation

```bash
npm install angular2-jwt
```

The library comes with several helpers that are useful in your Angular 2 apps.

1. `AuthHttp` - allows for individual and explicit authenticated HTTP requests
2. `AuthStatus` - allows you to check whether there is a non-expired JWT in local storage. This can be used for conditionally showing/hiding elements and stopping navigation to certain routes if the user isn't authenticated

## Sending Authenticated Requests

If you wish to only send a JWT on a specific HTTP request, you can use the `AuthHttp` class.

```ts
import {AuthHttp, AuthConfig} from 'angular2-jwt';

...

class App {

  thing: string;

  constructor(public authHttp: AuthHttp) {}

  getThing() {
    this.authHttp.get('http://example.com/api/thing')
      .subscribe(
        data => this.thing = data,
        err => console.log(error),
        () => console.log('Request Complete')
      );
  }
}

bootstrap(App, [
  HTTP_PROVIDERS,
  provide(AuthConfig, {
    useFactory: () => {
      return new AuthConfig();
    }
  }),
  AuthHttp
])
```

A default configuration for header and token details is provided:

* Header Name: `Authorization`
* Header Prefix: `Bearer`
* Token Name: `id_token`
* Token Getter Function: `(() => localStorage.getItem(tokenName))`
* Token Refresh Function `(() => Observable.of(null))`
* Token Refresh Offset: 60
* Supress error and continue with regular HTTP request if no JWT is saved: `false`

If you wish to configure the `headerName`, `headerPrefix`, `tokenName`, `tokenGetter` function, `refresh` function, `refreshOffset`, or `noJwtError` boolean, you can pass a config object when `AuthHttp` is injected.

By default, if there is no valid JWT saved, `AuthHttp` will throw an 'Invalid JWT' error. If you would like to continue with an unauthenticated request instead, you can set `noJwtError` to `true`.

```ts
...

bootstrap(App, [
  HTTP_PROVIDERS,
  provide(AuthConfig, { useFactory: () => {
    return new AuthConfig({
      headerName: YOUR_HEADER_NAME,
      headerPrefix: YOUR_HEADER_PREFIX,
      tokenName: YOUR_TOKEN_NAME,
      tokenGetter: YOUR_TOKEN_GETTER_FUNCTION,
      refresh: YOUR_TOKEN_REFRESH_FUNCTION,
      refreshOffset: YOUR_TOKEN_REFRESH_OFFSET,
      noJwtError: true
    })
  }}),
  AuthHttp
])
```

The `AuthHttp` class supports all the same HTTP verbs as Angular 2's Http.

### Sending Headers

You may send custom headers with your `authHttp` request by passing in an options object.

```ts
getThing() {
  var myHeader = new Headers();
  myHeader.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');

  this.authHttp.get('http://example.com/api/thing', { headers: myHeader} )
    .subscribe(
      data => this.thing = data,
      err => console.log(error),
      () => console.log('Request Complete')
    );

  // Pass it after the body in a POST request
  this.authHttp.post('http://example.com/api/thing', 'post body', { headers: myHeader} )
    .subscribe(
      data => this.thing = data,
      err => console.log(error),
      () => console.log('Request Complete')
    );
}
```

### Using the Observable Token Stream

If you wish to use the JWT as an observable stream, you can call `tokenStream` from `AuthHttp`.

```ts
...

tokenSubscription() {
  this.authHttp.tokenStream.subscribe(
      data => console.log(data),
      err => console.log(err),
      () => console.log('Complete')
    );
}
```

This can be useful for cases where you want to make HTTP requests out of obsevable streams. The `tokenStream` can be mapped and combined with other streams at will.

## Using JwtHelper in Components

The `JwtHelper` class has several useful methods that can be utilized in your components:

* `decodeToken`
* `getTokenExpirationDate`
* `isTokenExpired`

You can use these methods by passing in the token to be evaluated.

```ts

...

jwtHelper: JwtHelper = new JwtHelper();

...

useJwtHelper() {
  var token = localStorage.getItem('id_token');

  console.log(
    this.jwtHelper.decodeToken(token),
    this.jwtHelper.getTokenExpirationDate(token),
    this.jwtHelper.isTokenExpired(token)
  );
}

...
```

## Checking Login to Hide/Show Elements and Handle Routing

The `tokenNotExpired` function can be used to check whether a JWT exists in local storage, and if it does, whether it has expired or not. If the token is valid, `tokenNotExpired` returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.

The router's `@CanActivate` lifecycle hook can be used with `tokenNotExpired` to determine if a route should be accessible. This lifecycle hook is run before the component class instantiates. If `@CanActivate` receives `true`, the router will allow navigation, and if it receives `false`, it won't.

```ts

...

@Component({
  selector: 'secret-route'
})

@View({
  template: `<h1>If you see this, you have a JWT</h1>`
})

@CanActivate(() => tokenNotExpired())

class SecretRoute {}
```

You can pass a different `tokenName` for `@CanActivate` to use as the first argument to the function. If you wish to define your own function for `tokenNotExpired` to use, pass `null` first and then the function.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
